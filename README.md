# VGG-16-Dogs-Cats-Classification

## Introduction
Using VGG-16 as base model to classify input image to 3 classes(dogs, cats, others).

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- Tensorflow 2.2
- Keras 2.2

## How to train
1. Unzip the `dataset.zip` (feel free to collect your own dataset, just put them as same file stuctures)
2. Set correct `dataset path` and `hyperparameters` in training.py
3. Run `training.py`

## How to predict
1. Set correct `dataset path`
1. Run `predict.py`
